Problem:
    In what way is a recursive design different from top-down design?
Solution:
Recursive functions
• Recursive functions are a type of functions in which the same function it called itself in the body of the function.
• A recursion should have a base case and an iteration case.
• The base case is the termination point at which the program should halt. If the base case is not perfect then the
program never terminates and fall into infinite recursion.
W
• In case of infinite recursion, the python virtual machine runs out of memory and halts its execution indicating a
stack overflow error"
• The iteration case tells about how the function should be iterated to get the expected output
• Recursion reduces the size of the code and makes the code look more elegant.
